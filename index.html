                                Whatever your fitness goals, proper nutrition is necessary to reach them. 
                                Proper nutrition increases energy, enhances mood, improves memory, and 
                                helps you get a better night’s sleep! <br><br>
                                Nutrition coaching includes a personal calculation of macronutrients (protein, 
                                carbs, and fats) that you should consume each day. You will log your 
                                food each day and I will check your diary twice weekly and provide feedback. 
                                Once a week, we will have a check-in call to review the previous week and 
                                plan for the next week. <br><br> 
                                There are no forbidden foods, and you can still enjoy the food you love while reaching your goals!
